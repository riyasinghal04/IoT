# IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

In this project, we have implemented two smart systems:
1)Home Automation System(House Lighting System)
2)Smart Parking  System

Both these systems have a similar layout. The WebApp(developed with the help of javascript and jquery) is used to control the lights in the smart home system. Upon clicking the dessired button, appropriate command will be generated by the arduino and the associated light will be turned on and off accordingly.
Similarly, in the smart parking system, the IR sensors are used to detect the presence of a vehicle in the parking slot. If the vehicle is present, the slot will be identified as occupied on the webapp otherwise unoccupied will be displayed.

In both these systems, we have used Real Time Database FIREBASE in order to synchronise the data between the arduino and the webapp.
The Hardware used is NODEMCU which has inbuilt ESP8266 wifi module. Softwares used are HTML,CSS,Javascript,Arduino.
